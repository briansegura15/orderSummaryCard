## My process

Analyzed the design presented in the starter files. Worked with HTML file first then moved to CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

Worked on Flexbox again and was happy to use column direction for a change. Was having trouble with spacing in multiple places and took me a while to realize I had to hard reset the margin and padding in a different way to achieve what I wanted.
